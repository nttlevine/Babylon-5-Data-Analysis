# Babylon-5-Data-Analysis
This project was crated for my final project in an intro to programming class taught by Dr. Jeremy Foote of Purdue University
To start, you'll want to open the "P5_analysis.ipynb" notebook to look over the project and review my notes.
IMPORTANT NOTE: if you run the first cell of code for that file you will be downloading 111 text files so don't run that if you don't have the space to actually hold those files. The rest of the code won't be able to run with out it, but the outputs should still be viewable from when I ran the code last.
